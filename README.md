# 🖼️ Image Captioning Generator

This project implements an Image Captioning model that generates textual descriptions for input images using deep learning techniques. It combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM for sequence generation.
